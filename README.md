# 🚭 Smoking-Health-Risk-Analysis- Power Bi Dashboard
---
# 🧾 Project Description

This project focuses on visualizing and Smoking health Risks using a health dataset. I built an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks disease progression metrics, highlights differences between healthy and diseased scans, and visualizes them.
The project was inspired by and developed through a detailed, step-by-step YouTube tutorial by Isaac Emmanuel. His guide provided a structured approach to understanding how health data can be explored and communicated using business intelligence tools.
The goal of this project was not only to replicate the tutorial but also to improve my skills in Power BI, especially in areas like visual storytelling, healthcare analytics, DAX calculations, and advanced layout design.
