# 🫁 Smoking Health Risk Analysis

## 📋 Project Summary
This project analyzes smoking behavior and its associated health risks using patient-level data. The dashboard focuses on understanding smoking patterns, health conditions, and organ damage, while enabling interactive exploration across different organs and health risk factors.The analysis was performed in Power BI, with an emphasis on interactivity, visual clarity, and storytelling through data.

 ## 🧠 Problem Statement
Smoking is a major public health concern with well documented impacts on multtiple organs of the body. However, health risks across different organs and patient demographic is critical for effective health analysis and decision-making.
This project analyzes smoking-related health risks by comparing **damaged** and **healthy** organ conditions across key body systems, including the heart, lungs , liver,kidneys, and the overall human body. the goal is to provide a  clear, interactive overview of how smoking behavior  correlates with health indicators.

Using an interactive Power Bi dashboard, the analysis focuses on:
- Total number of patients
- Smoking status distribution
- Smoking duration and daily intake
- Cholesterol levels
- Hypertension risks
- Smoking patterns by gender


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI** - Data modelling, visualization and dashboard creation
- **Powe Query** - Data transformation
- **Dax** - Creation of calculated measures and KPIs
- **Power Point** - Dashboard background layout
- **YouTube** - Tutorial from analyst isaac emmanuel


## 🗂 Dataset Overview
Four datasets were transformed and loaded into Power BI. Minimal data cleaning was required, aside from minor formatting adjustments.
1. Health Dataset
Columns include:
- Patient ID 🆔
- Age 🎂
- Gender 🚻
- Smoking Status 🚬
- Years of Smoking ⏳
- Cigarettes per Day 📊
- Organ 🧠🫁
- Organ Condition (Healthy / Damaged)
- BMI ⚖️
- Blood Pressure Risk 🩺
- Cholesterol Level 🧪
- Family History Risk 🧬
- Alcohol Consumption 🍺
- Age Group 👥
2. Condition Table
- Organ Condition
3. Image Dataset
- Organ
- Organ Condition
- Image URL 🖼
4. Organs Table
- Organ
- Icon URL 🖱

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The dashboard was designed to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience.
Interactivity
Button slicers 🔘 and chiclet slicers 🟦
Dynamic filtering between Healthy and Damaged organ conditions
Organ-level exploration for:Heart ❤️,Human Body 🧍,Kidney 🫘,Liver,Lungs 🫁
Images and icons of organs
KPI cards displaying Total number of patients vsAverage age and average BMI
Visual analysis of percentage of smoking status , smoking status by gender, cholesterol and hypertension risk,smoking duration and daily intake
These feature allow users to quickly compare health outcoms and smoking patterns across different organ conditionsand demographics.
       
## ✅Tasks Performed

- Imported the cleaned datasets into Power BI
- Created DAX measures to calculate  metrics (Vs Average age,average BMi)
- Designed a custom dashboard layout in PowerPoint and used it as the visual background
- Used  image placeholders to display Organ images
 - Applied Slicers  for interactivity
- Organized visual elements using uniform themes, colors, and typography
- Published and tested interactive filters for improved usability

## Key Metrics & Visuals
- Total Patients 👥
- Percentage distribution of smoking status
- Smoking duration and daily cigarette intake
- Smoking status by gender
- Cholesterol and hypertension risk indicators

## 💡 Key Insights 
- Smoking behavior varies significantly across patients, with clear differences in smoking duration and daily intake among smoking status categories 🚬.
- Current and long-term smokers show stronger associations with elevated health risks such as cholesterol and hypertension 🩺.
- Gender-based analysis reveals noticeable variation in smoking status distribution, suggesting demographic differences in smoking habits 🚻.
- Organ-level analysis highlights a clear distinction between healthy and damaged conditions, reinforcing the relationship between prolonged smoking and organ health 🫁❤️.
- Interactive filtering allows users to explore how smoking intensity and health risks change across different organs and conditions, providing a holistic view of smoking-related health impacts.
These insights emphasize how smoking patterns are closely linked to broader health risk indicators and organ damage, rather than focusing on a single metric in isolation.


📌 Conclusion & Learnings
This project demonstrates how smoking behavior correlates with multiple health risk factors, including organ damage, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure risk. It also highlights the importance of interactive dashboards in uncovering patterns that may not be immediately visible in static reports.
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
- Data modeling and transformation
- Designing interactive Power BI dashboards
- Communicating health-related insights through visualization
